Some plugins I have written for [SwiftBar](https://swiftbar.app) (or [xbar](https://xbarapp.com) and other BitBar-like utilities), to put things in the macOS menu bar.

- **Caffeinate** - Prevent display sleep using the system command 'caffeinate' like the recently restarted [Caffeine](https://www.caffeine-app.net) app. Click to toggle on/off.
- **Hide Menu Icons** - Hide Menu bar icons to the left, like a simple version of the [Bartender](https://www.macbartender.com) app. Click to toggle visibility. (REQUIRES helper plugin and designed for SwiftBar)
